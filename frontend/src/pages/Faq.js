            <p>
              We recommend at least 0.5 NEAR to cover gas usage for blockchain transactions. If you buy NEAR tokens first time, don't forget
              to include transaction fees that you pay on withdraw NEAR tokens from crypto exchange.

              ChatMe was created to extend communication and data sharing in NEAR ecosystem. Also we found new possibilities for chats based
              on web3 technologies that simplify work with NFT, tokens and smart-contracts.

              NEAR is fast and secure blockchain with cheap transactions and great community. NEAR blockchain provide great user experience
              for new users, you don't need to install wallets or extensions to start using NEAR ecosystem, only your web browser.

            <p>
              For telegram or other messenger you connect by phone number or nickname. ChatMe can be used directly with native NEAR address
              and we build it to cover NEAR ecosystem needs. We don't try to replace telegram, viber, whatsApp or other
              messenger, but who knows :)

            index={10}
          >
            <p>
              All data in blockchain is publicly available but for direct messages we build private mode that encode data before sending to
              blockchain and decode in other side. For this process we use
              <a href="https://github.com/NEARFoundation/near-js-encryption-box" className={"faq-link"} target={"_blank"}>
                near-js-encryption-box library
              </a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To start using private mode your account need Gold Level. Open direct conversation and click "lock" icon to request privacy
              mode. You will receive a notification when request accepted and Private Mode will automatically be turned on
              (red color for the background and icons show that Private Mode is enabled).
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-3 text-red-300"}>
              NOTE: Private Mode not work in public/private chats, it is available only for direct conversations.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-3 text-red-300"}>
              We recommend to not send passwords or other important information because maybe in future current encoding algorithms can
              become insecure. You can find more details how encryption works and security details in our documentation.

          >
            <p>
              When we provide so cheap and fast messages there is area for spammers. That's why we add Account Levels to prevent spam in our
              messages. For example if you start sending spam from free account and 10 people report about spam in your messages, your
              account will be completely locked. If user pay for higher account level, we provide more trust and temporary lock account for
              few minutes after spam reports.
